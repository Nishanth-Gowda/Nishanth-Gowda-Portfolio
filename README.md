# Nishanth-Gowda-Portfolio

This is a resume portfolio website created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Typed.js. The website is designed to showcase my skills and experience as a developer and provide a platform to share my work and projects.

The website is built using an open-source project from Lucas Angelo as a starting point. This project was bootstrapped using the latest web development technologies and tools such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The website is hosted on AWS using S3 and CloudFront, which provides a fast and reliable platform for hosting web content. The use of S3 and CloudFront ensures that the website is highly available and can handle large amounts of traffic.

I would like to give credit to Lucas Angelo for providing the open-source project that was used to create this website. Without his work and contributions, this website would not have been possible.

Thank you for visiting my website, and I hope you enjoy exploring my work and projects. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to contact me.
